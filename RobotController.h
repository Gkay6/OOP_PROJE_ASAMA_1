  * This class is responsible for controlling the robot's movements (e.g., forward, backward, turn),
  * handling sensor updates (adding, updating sensors), and managing access control through password authentication.
  * The RobotController interacts with the RobotInterface API and maintains a list of sensors attached to the robot.
  * It also allows operators to command the robot's actions and check its status.
